If you are reading this blog post then we can assume that you have some knowledge of the event that will be happening on August 21st 2017. An eclipse of the Sun will result in the Moon's shadow passing across the USA.

It is estimated that 12 million people live in the path of totality. If weather conditions are good then these lucky people will witness a spectacle for nothing more than a well timed look out of their window or short stroll to position themselves in a location where the Sun is in their sights.

We must include in this group people who live only a short distance from the path of totality. If you're only mildly enthusiastic about the eclipse, an hour drive is a small sacrifice for the experience of witnessing a total eclipse of the Sun.

## If they're living in or near the path of the eclipse, then they HAVE to know already, right?!

Not necessarily. It is still possible that a significant proportion of the 12 million people that live in the path of totality have not organised themselves to know where they will be on the day and time of totality. If you know people who live in the path of totality, if you live in the path this may be most of the people you know, then ask them what their plans will be to view the eclipse. Asking them what their plans are, you are not assuming that they don't know but you will soon see from their reaction if they are hearing about this for the first time.

Maybe they do know about the eclipse but have not yet determined what time the eclipse will be in their area. You can help them by telling them what time the different phases of the eclipse will happen for them and at what time the main event of totality will happen.

You can also help them to know what preparations they need to make to observe the eclipse safely. If they haven't yet acquired some eclipse glasses then they will thank you for reminding them where they can get some glasses from.

If you are responsible for ONE person experiencing a total eclipse that would otherwise have skipped the event through ignorance you will have ONE person that will forever be thanksful to you for reaching out to them.

## It's not everybody's thing though!

Right. As hard as it is to believe some people know the eclipse is happening and perhaps their community is doing a great job of putting the word out and they are sick of hearing about it. The last thing they may want to hear is you encouraging them to get excited about an event that they could not be less interested.

Well, if you lead with the question "What are your plans for the eclipse?" then they will quickly reveal their intentions and you can engage them with a response if you want or just bid them good day.

It is worth risking repeating what people may already know, if there is a chance that you could help someone experience a potentially life changing event. Those that are tired of the "noise" about the eclipse will have their rest on August 22nd. :)

## If you're watching tell people what your plans are!

Consider changing your social media profile image to incorporate your intention to witness the eclipse.

But for those not on social media then don't forget to reach out to them because these are the least likely group to know already.
