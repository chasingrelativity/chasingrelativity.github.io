## Is it safe to view a solar eclipse without eye protection?

The simply answer is no. But let's consider that question.

For those lucky enough to be positioned in the umbral shadow of the moon the brief moments of totality can be viewed safely without the need for protection. The eclipse of August 21st 2017 will provide up to 2 minutes and 40 seconds of totality. The sun's atmosphere will be visible, also known as the corona. This will be set against a sky which will be similar in brightness as you would experience at twilight.

During the period of totality you can also look at the obscured disk of the sun through binoculars or a telescope.

## 1% of the sun's light is enough to damage your eyes

Although totality is the peak of the eclipse experience you will want to be prepared to safely observe the phases of the partial eclipse. Even a small percentage of the sun's light is dangerous for our eyes.

## Be prepared

A common way to view the eclipse safely is using special glasses that filter out all of the dangerous light of the sun.

While wearing these glasses you will see the form of the sun and you will also be able to possibly detect some dark spots on the sun known as sunspots. These glasses can be ordered from many online stores. As the eclipse approaches then it may be possible to pick up some glasses for free with a newspaper or as a promotion with a local store but our advice is that you prepare and purchase them early.

An alternative way to view the eclipse safely is indirectly. You can purchase solar projectors quite cheaply. During the partial eclipse that was visible over the UK in 2015 we had great success with solar projector below from [AstroMediaShop](http://www.astromediashop.co.uk/).

If you have a telescope or binoculars you can set these up to project an image of the eclipse on to a piece of card. You must not look through the lens of the telescope or binoculars unless you have a solar filter which you can buy or create your own.

We recommend that a solar projector is the best and safest way for young children to view the eclipse. If you provide young children with glasses then you will be concerned that they don't always wear them correctly. With a solar projector you can gather around the safe reflected image of the sun and you can discuss with them what is happening to keep their interest.
